# User guide
After installation, a new side panel will be created for Metrics Tracker. Ensure that the "NPC Kill Tracker" setting is checked within the Metrics Tracker plugin. After that, all you have to do is kill some monsters and they will be tracked. Currently, it tracks monsters based off the player dealing damage to them, so it will not track party monsters killed, and may have difficulty tracking if someone other than you deals the final hit to the monster.
